# Contributors & Profit-Share Program

Welcome to the Unseen Advantage private core repository. Participation is by invitation only and subject to our proprietary licensing terms.

## Contribution Requirements
- Sign and return the Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA).
- Follow the Engineering Handbook guidelines for security, privacy, and data handling.
- Include automated tests and relevant documentation with every change.
- Submit contributions via pull request using the provided templates.

> **CLA Access:** Request the current ICLA at [https://app.unseenadvantage.com/cla](https://app.unseenadvantage.com/cla). Contributions are accepted only after the CLA is executed.

## Profit-Share Summary
- **Pool:** A fixed percentage of net SaaS revenue is allocated monthly to the contributor pool.
- **Accrual:** Eligible contributions accrue monthly, with funds released after a six-month vesting cliff.
- **Weighting (K-Factor):** Grants are weighted by code merged, issues resolved, and business impact. Optional referral impact may apply.
- **Transparency:** Contributors receive access to a private ledger and have the right to audit calculations.
- **No IP Transfer:** Contributors retain their personal IP; the CLA grants Unseen Advantage the necessary licenses without transferring ownership.

## Profit-Share Process
1. Monthly revenue and cost data are normalized to compute the pool balance.
2. Contribution metrics are scored and normalized using the K-Factor weighting model.
3. Payouts are issued as ProfitShareGrant entries with CSV export for accounting.
4. Contributors can request recalculation or audit within 30 days of grant issuance.
